# Charter README

This repo contains the organization charter, which details the mission statement, organization heirarchy, basic operating procedures, membership requirements, and community standards.

To make changes or amendments to the charter, you must be part of the Steering Committee. However, constructive suggestions and criticism are always welcome from the community, and can be discussed in the [Ideas section of the Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/eddb2-0/discussions/categories/-ccs-ideas-amendments).
