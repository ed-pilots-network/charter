# Elite Dangerous Pilot's Network - Organizational Charter

Adopted: {{ INSERT_DATE_OF_ADOPTION_BY_STEERING_COMMITTEE }}

DISCLAIMER: This Charter is a draft and a work in progress. Not all descriptions and definitions are concrete or accepted currently.

This Charter - (the "Charter") - sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for all contribution to, and oversight of the Elite Dangerous Pilot's Network Project (the "Project"). All Community Members of the Project must comply with the terms of the Charter and the Community Standards.

## 1 - Mission

### 1.0 - Mission Statement

The Mission of the Project is to:

1. Create and maintain a successful, "from scratch", free and open source software (FOSS) alternative to/replacement for EDDB - Elite Dangerous DataBase - the website/tool used by thousands of players of the Elite Dangerous video game.

2. Create, harbor, and maintain the EDPN Community (the "Community") as a welcoming, (mostly) virtual [Community of Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_interest) and [Community of Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice).
   - Those who simply engage (take part in discussions on Discord, GitHub, or other source) in the community are considered part of the Community of Interest.
   - Those who contribute, in any form, to the technical project are considered part of the Community of Interest **and** the Community of Practice.

## 2 - Community Roles

### 2.0 - Preface

#### 2.0.1 - Volunteering, Life Balance, and Leadership

Each of the following roles are loosely described and the requirements listed are not strict requirements but generalized expectations. It is acknowledged and understood that each Community Member that contributes to the Project is a _volunteer_, and the expectations do not strictly need to be followed. As we strive for inclusitivity and understanding, situations such as: "My kid's baseball game takes precedence over my ability to contribute, but I'd still like to." are completely understandable, and the community will attempt to make reasonable accomodations for all members.

However, if it is deemed by the Steering Committee that an individual in a leadership position or position with higher expectations is no longer capable of fulfilling the responsibilities/expectations in accordance with the Charter, whether due to repeated absences, failure(s) to meet role expectations within reasonable timing, failure(s) to communicate absences/inability, or similar reasons, the following actions are permitted:

- The individual will be asked by the SC to step down in favor of a more apt candidate.
- The Steering Committee may appoint a fill-in or co-leadership position to take over.

In either resulting option, if there is no candidate to replace the role, the members of Steering Committee must (unanimously) select one Steering Committee member from their ranks to temporarily shoulder the burden of responsibility. If this results in an imbalance of power on the Steering Committee, no decisions may pass the Steering Committee until the quorum is met.

##### 2.0.1.1 - Mentorship

{{ TBD - A section on mentoring (programming, leadership, soft skills, etc.) }}

#### 2.0.2 - Concurrent Roles

The following rules apply to roles such that no one entity holds too much authority or power over others or the project, and such that there is a spread of responsibility between enough members.

1. Members cannot be a d-e SC member and be a WGL concurrently. One can only be a d-e member of the SC or an elected WGL, exclusively.

2. Members cannot hold more than one WGL or SC position.

3. Members cannot be a Discord Admin and Discord Moderator concurrently.

{{ TBD - Concurrency between: Discord <--> GitHub, SC <--> Discord|GitHub, WGL <--> Discord }}

### 2.2 - Developer

#### 2.2.1 - Definition

Developers are those who have explicitly applied and been confirmed to be a Developer of/on the Project and/or Community. This role also grants membership into the GitHub organization, the ability to join one or more Work Groups, certain voting rights in public elections and polls, and is the main prerequisite to be able to run for leadership roles.

---

### 2.3 - Contributor

#### 2.3.1 - Definition

Contributors are those who have added value, code, documenation, or other forms of content to the Project, who are not explicitly Developers. Since the Project is a FOSS project, and anyone can contribute to such a project, this role is simply a title and acknowledgement of contribution(s) to the project. They do not receive membership in the GitHub organization (but likely instead, collaborator), voting rights, or the ability to run for leadership roles.

#### 2.4.1 - Definition

Work Group Leads are the primary drivers and heads of each of the three primary Work Groups: Frontend, Backend, and Operations. Each WGL is responsible for technical direction of, collecting and considering input from, and the code integrity of , their corresponding WG. Each WGL also serves on the SC to aid in and vote on project level decisions.

  - EP: Yes
    - Elected By: Developer
  - Prior Role: Developer
  - Activity Level: Unless handled/satisfied by another known Developer's response from the WG, the WGL responds to Discord **@WGL-{{WrkGrp}}** (where 'WrkGrp' corresponds to the first letter of the WG they are the lead for (F,B,S)) or Discord direct-mentions within 48 hours

#### 2.4.2 - Duties

{{ TBD }}

---

### 2.5 - Steering Committee

#### 2.5.1 - Definition

The SC - Steering Committee - is made up of four direcly elected Community Members and three elected Work Group Leaders. With an odd parity of members, this ensures that a stalemate can never be reached. The quorum of seven, meaning all seven members are aware of and acknowledge a decision, poll, etc., must be met for any decision to take place. The SC will be responsible for technical oversight of the open source Project and the Community in accordance with Project Charter, foundational principles, Contributor Guidelines, and Community Standards.

- Role Requirements
  - EP: Yes
    - Elected By: Developer
  - Prior Role: Developer
  - Activity Level: Responds to Discord **@Steering Committee** mentions within 48 hours, and Discord direct-mentions within 36 hours

#### 2.5.2 - Duties

The duties of the Steering Committee members are:

1. The same as every Developer.

2. To produce the final say/decision on large items or discussions that involve the Project. These include, but are not limited to, topics such as large software stack selections, hosting selections, features of the project, events, hearing potential appeals by Community Members, Contributors, Developers, etc.

   2a. The SC must explain and justify why they bring a decision to their oversight and authority.

   2b. The SC must take due consideration of the Community's input on all decisions before made final. Such condsideration must be recognizable, justifiable, and explanable by the SC.

   2c. While the SC has a vague description of oversight power, if the Community believes any decision by the SC violates the Community Standards or does not fully align with the Mission, those who are confirmed Developers may organize and submit a vote of no-confidence to overrule the SC's decision. A simple two thirds majority of Developer votes is needed to overrule the decision.

3. To develop and maintain the Charter, Contributor Guidelines, and Community Standards.

4. To develop and maintain the Project roadmap and Project kanban board.

5. To process memberships/applications for Community Members.

6. To organize and process public and non-public polls that affect the Project.

7. To organize and process elections for the SC, WGL, GitHub Admin, and Discord Admin.

8. To assign the (end)dates of decisions, polls, and elections, with due consideration of the Community and roadmap.

These duties are split among SC members, such that there is (hopefully) an even workload for each member.

## 3 - Elections, Polls, & Voting

### 3.0 - Structure and Procedures

#### 3.0.1 - Placing A Vote & Election Discussions

Actual voting will occur on GitHub in the corresponding category's "Polls" discussion forum. Each poll or election will be a separate discussion thread. If required, candidates in an election will produce any statements as comments/replies to the initial discussion post. Eligible voters will place their vote as requested in the Discussion post.

Actual discussion(s) on or around the poll/election will take place (in realtime) on a simlarly named thread in Discord under **DEVS/#polls**. {{ TBD - separate dev and public poll channels }}

This dictates that only those who are members of the GitHub organization can vote, and discuss the election via the **Developer** role on Discord. This separation of temporary discussion/conversation and election results also serves the interest of better public record keeping.

#### 3.0.2 - Election & Poll Types

##### 3.0.2.1 - Elections

Elections take place for leadership roles. All **Developers**, subject to each role's candidacy requirements, may run for **one** (at a time) of the positions that are elected:

|      Position     |     Total Available    |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| SC                | 4                      |
| WGL               | 3 - FEnd, BEnd, or Ops |
| GitHub Admin      | 2(min) or 3(max)       |
| GitHub Maintainer | 2 (per repository)     |
| Discord Admin     | 2(min) or 3(max)       |
| Discord Moderator | 3                      |

##### 3.0.2.2 - Polls

The following list details the current poll types.

- Feature Poll
  - Purpose: One (or more) Work Group(s) (via a WGL) or the SC are requesting input on a product/project feature.
  - Voters: Variable from all Community Members to only the SC.
  - Submitter: SC, WGL
- Requirement Poll
  - Purpose: One (or more) Work Group(s) (via a WGL) or the SC are requesting input on a product/project requirement.
  - Voters: Variable, but staged. Initial "Stage 1" poll would be made up of Community Members (for popular interest/vote), and the final vote could come from the SC.
    - Submitter: SC, WGL
- Technical Poll
  - Purpose: One (or more) Work Group(s) (via a WGL) are requesting input on a method or procedure that is integral to the Work Group.
  - Voters: Developers and Contributors
  - Submitter: SC, WGL
- Community Poll
  - Purpose: Generally, it is a popular vote on something. If enough Community Members gather around an idea, motion, decision, or other topic that requires a majority of opinions or beliefs, they may request a Community Poll from the SC.
  - Voters: Community Members
  - Submitter: Any Community Member, proxied through any SC member (WGLs included)
- Weight Poll
  - Purpose: Among multiple options, such as Feature Requests or Requirements, the most or least important/priority must be decided.
  - Voters: Variable, depending on audience.
  - Submitter: Variable, depending on audience.

#### 3.0.3 - Start and End Dates

Elections and polls will have specified start and end date, selected by the SC, with due consideration of the Community Members and roadmap. Submission of votes, from anyone, regardless of role, may not occur before the start date or after the end date. The following are just examples of time frames for each kind of election. Each poll will be situationally specific and likely different for each poll.

Elections:

- SC Member & WGL: 72 hours
- GitHub/Discord Admin: 48 hours

#### 3.0.4 - Candidacy Notes

While there is no engagement level requirements of the Developer to prove community involvement or contributions, candidates are obviously much more likely to be effective candidates if they are actively engaged in the community and can show a history of contributing to the Project.
